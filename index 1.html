								<p>Social media is beginning to become normal. Everyone is using it. It is mainly used for e-mail, games and business. But social networking sites will soon take over. In 1995, Larry Page and Sergei Brin were introduced to the graduate students of computer science at Stanford University. In January 1996, the two began collaborating to write a program for a search engine called BackRub. Next, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were driven by enthusiastic comments gathered from BackRub and started working on Google..</p>
								<p>Social media will affect not only our mobile phones but also our daily lives. The popularity of social media is high and we are not immersed in the digital world now, but we arrive at an unfamiliar trough. As a result, people do not know how to be alone. They are afraid of looking "lonely" or "unpopular", so they can not tolerate the idea of ​​going down the hall, the audience going through it, or sitting alone in public places. But being alone means nothing that you are alone. This means that you are confident in your identity and do not need any digital verification to say to you. Many people afraid of loneliness do not know who they are. The first step to recover? It is self love. I know your core people. Please do not tell the Internet or other people in another way. I accept who you are. I'm sorry about what kind of person you are. Love yourself unconditionally.</p>
								<p>Social media has a big impact on individuals and their lives. While some impacts may be positive, social media has proved to have a negative impact on our mood and stress level elements. Addiction is also caused by social media. Easily accessible from our mobile phone, even while sleeping, in the bed, the classroom the professor speaks, sometimes seen everywhere during meals. This is some aspect of social media addiction that can have negative effects.</p>
								<p>The endless positive and negative impact of social media influences our society today. Meanwhile, social media communicate with each other, connect with people at the social and business level, share our lives with others and create an easy way to entertain us when we need it It was. On the other hand, social media can cause isolation under many circumstances, it is jeopardized when we do not know who we are talking to, causing trouble for ourselves, work related to academic and work It hinders. Everyone who uses social media needs to set restrictions on himself to confirm that his experience is more positive than negative one. Once done, social media can be used as a tool for doing wonderful things.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Pros</h2>
								
								<p>Reduces Communication Barriers
									Decades ago, the world relied solely on letters to communicate with people in distant places. Communication was hampered as a result, and relationships suffered greatly. 
									
									Now, Social media has enabled us to stay in touch with people both nearby and far away. And, with the rise of social media, distance is no longer an obstacle.
									
									Social Impact
									NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), fundraisers, etc use social media for a variety of noble purposes. 
									
									Generally, it is intended to raise awareness and assist people in discovering numerous changes that can help them improve their life. 
									
									This helps create a social impact on a large number of people right from your fingertips. 
									
									Brand Promotions
									Businesses big or small can easily promote their brand effectively and efficiently through the use of social media and receive a massive amount of engagement. 
									
									Social media has become an excellent place for advertisement, which helps the brands to know the needs of their audience well. This benefits businesses of all sizes greatly.
									
									This has led to an increase in the need for social media marketers. 
									
									Employment Opportunities
									The increased use of social media as a marketing tool has increased the demand for social media marketers. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Cons</h2>
								
								<p>Disadvantages of Social Media
									The dangers of social media are massive, despite the fact that it has numerous benefits, the effects of social media can lead to harmful results sometimes.
									
									Lack of Security
									As social media has become more accessible to anyone with an internet connection, people have become more vulnerable to hacking. 
									
									Many users upload important parts of their lives to social media platforms, communicate with people they don’t know, and are uneducated about the do and don’ts of having a social media account. 
									
									This leads to hackers taking advantage of such people and end up costing them their valuable information.
									
									Leads To Addiction 
									The ability to interact and contact friends and family at any time and from anywhere, along with a great volume of content, has led to social media addiction. 
									
									People spend more time on social media, communicating with people all over the world, and consuming content, and as a result, they get disconnected from their surroundings.
									
									Unrealistic Expectations
									What we see on social media is the ‘ideal’ part of a person’s life, and not their insecurities and problems. 
									
									When we forget this, we start to compare the negative parts of our lives with the positive parts of the lives of our peers that we see online. In the long run, this damages our self-esteem.
									
									Adverse Influence on Children
									Children who are addicted to social media spend hours per day watching videos, photos, and other content posted by the accounts they follow. 
									
									Other activities, such as schoolwork, sports, study, and other productive routines, are jeopardized by this addiction. In the end, the influence of social media negatively impacts the well-being of children.
									
									It also affects their socializing skills as they find it more comfortable to talk behind the phone rather than facing the person. 
									
									In conclusion, social media offers both benefits and drawbacks, but it all relies on the individual who uses it. .</p>
